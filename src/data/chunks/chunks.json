  "Internship Description: One-Month ML/MLOps Engineering Internship (DDQ Project) Project Overview DDQ is an internal project that has already been implemented. The goal of this internship is to refactor and optimize the DDQ system with a focus on improving code quality, performance, observability, and maintainability. The intern will gain hands-on experience with modern ML tools, vector databases, and infrastructure automation through real-world contributions. Duration 1 Month (Full-time) Internship Goals ●​ Understand and improve the DDQ codebase​ ●​ Optimize vector handling and pipeline performance​ ●​ Enhance the development workflow with CI/CD and observability​ ●​ Deliver a functional and well-documented system improvement​ Internship Plan and Steps Week 1: Onboarding and Setup 1.​ Set up Local Development and Test Environment​ ○​ Clone the DDQ repository​ ○​ Install necessary dependencies​ ○​ Verify project runs locally and passes basic tests​ 2.​ Basic Tutorials and Learning​ ○​ Short learning modules on:​ ■​ Large Language Models (LLMs)​ ■​ Embeddings and vector stores​ ■​ ML pipelines and orchestration​ Week 2: Codebase Familiarization and Initial Refactoring 3.​ Explore DDQ Codebase​ ○​ Read and understand the current code structure​ ○​ Trace the data and model pipelines​ ○​ Note key components, responsibilities, and data flows​ 4.​ Document the Current System Flow​ ○​ Create a visual/system flow diagram​ ○​ Write notes explaining the flow of data and API interactions​ 5.​ Identify Bottlenecks and Poor Design Patterns​ ○​ Use profiling tools to identify slow or resource-heavy operations​ ○​ Highlight hardcoded logic, redundancy, or non-modular code​ Week 3: Optimization and Infrastructure Enhancements 6.​ Propose Optimization Plan​ ○​ Present a short document or slide deck with:​ ■​ Refactoring proposals​ ■​ Expected performance gains or code improvements​ ■​ Timeline and steps for implementation​ 7.​ Implement Optimization​ ○​ Refactor inefficient or messy parts of the code​ ○​ Improve modularity and maintainability​ ○​ Optimize vector collection handling and API interactions​ 8.​ Begin Work on Centralized Model APIs​ ○​ Design a shared interface for multiple models​ ○​ Standardize input/output structure​ 9.​ CI/CD Configuration​ ○​ Set up or improve CI/CD pipelines​ ○​ Add automated testing, linting, and deployment steps​ 10.​Add Observability Tools​ ●​ Integrate tools such as:​ ○​ Prometheus for metrics​ ○​ Grafana for dashboards​ ○​ Basic logging and alerting​ Week 4: Finalization and Deployment 11.​Write Monitoring Scripts​ ●​ Health check endpoints​ ●​ Uptime monitoring​ ●​ Basic performance logging​ 12.​Complete Optimization Tasks​ ●​ Finalize all code updates​ ●​ Ensure compatibility with existing components​ 13.​Deploy Updated Services​ ●​ Deploy to local and/or staging environments​ ●​ Ensure system stability and monitor initial behavior​ 14.​Monitor and Log System Performance​ ●​ Use observability stack to track improvements​ ●​ Validate system behavior under test load​ 15.​Documentation​ ●​ Summarize changes and improvements​ ●​ Update project README and technical documentation​ 16.​Final Presentation​ ●​ Prepare a brief presentation​ ●​ Share work completed, lessons learned, and next steps​ ●​ Demo performance and architecture improvements to the team​ Skills and Tools You’ll Use ●​ Python (for backend and ML)​ ●​ Git & GitHub​ ●​ Docker​ ●​ Prometheus, Grafana​ ●​ CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)​ ●​ Vector DBs, LLM libraries (e.g.,",
